Comparison of different filter types
====================================

1. Design the following four filters:
  * Characteristic: low-pass
  * Types:
    * Butterworth
    * Chebyshev Typ 1
    * Chebyshev Typ 2
    * Cauer
  * Parameters:
    * Filter order `N = 5`
    * Cutoff / edge frequency `f_g` = 10 kHz
    * Passband ripple (if applicable): `R` = 3 dB
    * Stopband attenuation (if applicable): `D` = âˆ’40 dB
2. Visualize the frequency response of the filters around the cutoff frequency.  
Indicate the -3 dB threshold as well as the required stopband attenuation.
3. Compare the frequency responses. Especially consider:
  1. The edge frequency of the passband.
  2. The edge frequency of the stopband.
  3. The width of the transition band.
4. Discuss possible applications for the individual filter types.
